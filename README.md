This is a wikipedia-type app to teach web development and Rails4.

It was built by Michelle Bonat with my awesome mentor John Sawers for the Bloc program.

See the config/application.yml and its blank template config/application.example.yml

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
